Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> assign
Rule 1     assign -> ID ASSIGN NUMBER
Rule 2     print -> PRINT ID

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ASSIGN               : 1
ID                   : 1 2
NUMBER               : 1
PRINT                : 2
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

assign               : 0
print                : 

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . assign
    (1) assign -> . ID ASSIGN NUMBER

    ID              shift and go to state 2

    assign                         shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> assign .



state 2

    (1) assign -> ID . ASSIGN NUMBER

    ASSIGN          shift and go to state 3


state 3

    (1) assign -> ID ASSIGN . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (1) assign -> ID ASSIGN NUMBER .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (assign -> ID ASSIGN NUMBER .)
